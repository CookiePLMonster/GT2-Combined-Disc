# Gran Turismo 2 Combined Disc

Gran Turismo 2, other than being one of the more fondly remembered installments of the franchise, has one unique aspect
not seen in any other Gran Turismo to date -- it's split between two discs.
This modification combines both discs for an ultimate and complete version of Gran Turismo 2.

Due to the nature of this mod, the setup process is slightly more involved than the usual:
1. Download the setup script.
2. Install **Python 3.8.0** or newer. If you don't have it installed yet, you may get it from the Microsoft Store.
3. Run `setup.py` by double-clicking it like any other executable file. If due to your local setup the script does not run,
launch it with `python setup.py` or `python3 setup.py` in the Command Prompt.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions. Remember that you may easily "type" the full path to the file by dragging it to the command line window.
It's useful to easily input full paths to the Arcade and Simulation discs.
5. Wait for the setup to complete. Please be patient -- it takes a while, as it needs to repack discs and the game assets.
