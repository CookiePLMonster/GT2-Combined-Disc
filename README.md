# Gran Turismo 2 Combined Disc

Gran Turismo 2, other than being one of the more fondly remembered installments of the franchise, has one unique aspect
not seen in any other Gran Turismo to date -- it's split between two discs.
This modification combines both discs for an ultimate and complete version of Gran Turismo 2.

Due to the nature of this mod, the setup process is slightly more involved than the usual:
1. Download the setup script. **Do note that GTVolTool used by this script is Windows only.**
2. Install **Python 3.8.0** or newer. If you don't have it installed yet, Python can be downloaded from here:
   * Standalone: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
   * Microsoft Store: <https://www.microsoft.com/p/python-310/9pjpw5ldxlz5>
3. Run `setup.py` by double-clicking it like any other executable file. If due to your local setup the script does not run,
launch it with `python setup.py` or `python3 setup.py` in the Command Prompt.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions. The script will bring up a system file picker to select files by default, but this may be changed by starting the script with a `-t` parameter.
  Remember that you may easily "type" the full path to the file by dragging it to the command line window - it's useful for easily putting full paths to the Arcade and Simulation discs.
5. Wait for the setup to complete. Please be patient - it takes a while, as it needs to repack discs and the game assets.

## Version compatibility
The modification is compatible with all game versions, **except for NTSC-J v1.0**.

## Hardware compatibility
* PSP/PS Vita can use the full version of the mod in PBP format.
* On PS1, the full version is compatible with [XStation](https://castlemaniagames.com/products/xstation).
  You should opt for the lightweight version (without FMVs) **only** if burning the image on a physical CD.
